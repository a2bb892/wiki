Eventually we'd like it to be possible to write adapters (e.g. ZigBee adapter, Z-Wave adapter) in different programming languages, have them run in their own process, and talk to them via some kind of IPC mechanism.

But for our initial NodeJS prototype weâ€™ve discussed having some kind of uniform JavaScript interface for the web app to talk to adapters.

Based on the [Web Thing REST API](https://moziot.github.io/wot/) which will be a layer above this JavaScript API, my first thoughts on the what basic underlying features of the adapter layer might be are:

**Adapter**

- **discoverDevices()** // List available or connected devices so we can compare with list of devices already added
- **connectDevice()** // Pair with the device and/or get a connected device's details to add it to the gateway database
- **disconnectDevice()** // Unpair device if such a mechanism exists for this adapter

**Thing**
- **getProperty()** // Get a property value by its name
- **setProperty()** // Set a property value by its name
- **executeAction()** // What kinds of functions can we execute on  ZigBee/Z-Wave devices?
- **subscribe()**  // What kinds of events or changes we can listen or subscribe to from ZigBee/Z-Wave devices?

Does this make sense? What have I missed?
