# Method 1 - use a Lutron LZL-4B Connected Bulb Remote Control

It appears that this device has been discontinued. I managed to find one at Home Depot.
It looks like this: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla-iot/wiki/master/Photos/lutron-light-bulbs-changers-adapters-lzl-4b-wh-l01-c3_1000.jpg" width="400">

1. Hold the remote within 4 inches of the bulb.
1. Press and hold the 2nd (up arrow) and 4th (light off) buttons simultaneously.
1. The bulb should blink on and off
1. The green LED on the remote should come on and may blink a few times.
1. Continue to hold both buttons on the remote until the green LED goes off completely.

# Method 2 - Use the Philips Hue Hub/Bridge

I tried following the steps posted here:
