Repeat steps 1-4 until the bulb blinks. This should happen on the 3rd cycle, or the 4th time that the bulb is turned on.

You can now press + in the gateway and you should see the bulb show up within 10-15 seconds. Note: You may have to cycle the bulb on and off while scanning for new devices for the gateway to discover the bulb.
