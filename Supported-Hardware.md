With Project Things, Mozilla aims to create interoperability and user choice on the Internet of Things. Mozilla does not endorse any particular smart home product or brand, but here are the devices and protocols which have been tested  so far with the [Things Gateway](https://iot.mozilla.org/gateway).

## Gateway

### Raspbian

* Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+
* Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) (recommended)
* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
* Raspberry Pi Zero W

### OpenWrt

## Adapters

### Zigbee

* [Digi XStick](https://www.digi.com/products/xbee-rf-solutions/boxed-rf-modems-adapters/xstick) (ZB mesh version)

### Z-Wave

* [Sigma Designs UZB Stick](http://www.vesternet.com/z-wave-sigma-designs-usb-controller)
