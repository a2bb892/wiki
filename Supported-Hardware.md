With Project Things, Mozilla aims to create interoperability and user choice on the Internet of Things. Mozilla does not endorse any particular smart home product or brand, but here are the devices and protocols which have been tested  so far with the [Things Gateway](https://iot.mozilla.org/gateway).

## Gateway

### Raspbian

* Raspberry Pi 1 Model B
* Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+
* Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) (RPi 3 models recommended)
* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus/)
* Raspberry Pi Zero W

### OpenWrt

* [Experimental OpenWrt package](https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tree/master/lang/node-mozilla-iot-gateway) (while not yet optimized for commercial use, we recommend Turris Omnia, Linksys WRT3200ACM, Espressobin, Raspberry Pi 3, or similar powerful processors and platforms with plenty of RAM and flash) 

### Debian

* Experimental [Linaro](https://www.linaro.org/) support for some [96boards](https://www.96boards.org/products/) hardware
  * DragonBoard 410c
  * HiKey960
  * Rock960
  * Ultra96

## Adapters

### Zigbee

* [Digi XStick](https://www.digi.com/products/xbee-rf-solutions/boxed-rf-modems-adapters/xstick) (ZB mesh version)
* [ConBee Zigbee USB stick](https://www.dresden-elektronik.de/funktechnik/solutions/wireless-light-control/gateways/conbee/?L=1&cHash=c9c902ccdb43164696acccf81b62b2bd)

### Z-Wave

* [Sigma Designs UZB Stick](http://www.vesternet.com/z-wave-sigma-designs-usb-controller)
* [Aeotec Z-Stick](http://aeotec.com/z-wave-usb-stick) (Gen5)
* Any [OpenZWave compatible dongle](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/wiki/Controller-Compatibility-List) should work, but have not all been tested

**Note:** Additional adapters can be supported via add-ons, which are being added to all the time.
