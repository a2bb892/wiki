With WebThings, Mozilla aims to create interoperability and user choice on the Internet of Things. Mozilla does not endorse any particular smart home product or brand, but here are the devices and protocols which have been tested so far with the [WebThings Gateway](https://iot.mozilla.org/gateway).

**Note:** This list is far from complete. There are many more devices which are compatible which have not been added to this list by developers or users.

## Gateway

### Raspbian

* Raspberry Pi 1 Model B
* [Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b-plus/)
* [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)
* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) (RPi 3 models recommended)
* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus/)
* [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
* [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)

### Debian

* Experimental [Linaro](https://www.linaro.org/) support for some [96boards](https://www.96boards.org/products/) hardware
  * DragonBoard 410c
  * HiKey960
  * Rock960
  * Ultra96

## USB Dongles

### Zigbee

* Digi XStick2 (XU-Z11) - [link1](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/XU-Z11?R=0virtualkey0virtualkeyXU-Z11), [link2](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/digi-international/XU-Z11/602-1144-ND/2199598)
* [ConBee Zigbee USB stick](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee)
* [ConBee II Zigbee USB stick](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2)

### Z-Wave

* [Zwave.me UZB Stick](https://z-wave.me/uzb/)
* [Aeotec Z-Stick](http://aeotec.com/z-wave-usb-stick) (Gen5) - note the Z-Stick Gen 5 isn't recognized when plugged in directly to the Raspberry Pi 4. Some hubs seem to allow it to work. In particular, it works for me using [this one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/961) as an unpowered hub.
* [Zooz S2 USB Stick](http://www.getzooz.com/zooz-zst10-s2-stick.html)
* Any [OpenZWave compatible dongle](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/wiki/Controller-Compatibility-List) should work, but have not all been tested

**Note:** Additional adapters can be supported via add-ons, which are being added all the time.

The following Xiaomi devices have been seen working, but most of the battery powered Xiaomi devices do not follow
the Zigbee spec, and may or may not work reliably. Some devices will work for a while after paired, but then stop
working. This may depend on the other "router" devices found on the Zigbee network. Apparently, Xiaomi is addressing this and some newer devices are Zigbee 3.0 compliant.
